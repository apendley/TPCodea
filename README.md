TPCodea
=======

Installation:

If you have already set up Texture Packer's exporter directory, skip to step 3. 

1. Create a new directory somewhere
2. Open TexturePacker, and go to Preferences->Settings, and browse to the directory you just created in the Exporter Directory field
3. Copy the CodeaTab and CodeaChunk folders into the Exporter Directory

That's in! You'll have 2 new Data Format options in Texture Packer: Codea (project tab) and Codea (chunk).

For now I'll leave it up to you to figure out how to actually get your sprite sheets into Codea and use them, but very soon I'll have more info on how to do that, as well as a Codea class to use the generated sprite sheets.
